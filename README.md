# WeClone-WeChatMsg

This repository is forked from https://github.com/xming521/WeClone. The only difference is that this repository could handle datasets extracted from [WeChatMsg](https://github.com/LC044/WeChatMsg/tree/master), and optimizes the data preprocessing.

To tune the LLM model with your chat history, firstly download [MemoTrace](https://memotrace.cn/). Log in to WeChat PC and migrate your WeChat data to it. Then export your chat histories to CSV files. Then follow the same procedure as instructed in WeClone repository.
